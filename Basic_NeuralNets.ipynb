    "## Introduction\n",
    "We humans are really good at recognizing and making sense of objects around us by simply looking at them, and we do this instantly without realizing it. But the same task is not as easy as for computers. They cannot understand what they have given by defining some conditions easily. \n",
    "\n",
    "To be able to make computers to recognize objects we may use neural networks. Neural network was a tool for machine learning at the first then they improved the functions and algorithms, and they make it the basics of \"Deep Learning\". \n",
    "\n",
    "Neural networks as we defined in machine learning, they need __test data__ to learn from. If we give accurate training data then we can use them to teach computer. After iterations then we will use test data to calculate accuracy. If we increase the number of examples in training data, the accuracy of algorithm might increase.(I used \"might\" because using proper data is essential on data)\n",
